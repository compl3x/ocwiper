# ocwiper - (o)pen ( c ) file wiper
---
Like SDelete, but open-source, versatile and hackable.

#### Why use ocwiper?
---
1. Open-source
2. Cross platform
3. Easily modifiable
4. Usable with software built for SDelete (such as [my GUI](https://github.com/compl3x/SDelete2-FileGone))

#### Version 2

Version 2 features a more readable rewrite of the initial code, as well as the replacement of mtwist with pcg for our data generator.

It also includes an automatic filename scrambler

#### To-Do (version 2)
---

* ~~File deletion~~
* ~~(Recursive) directory support~~
* ~~Read-only forcing~~
* ~~Filename scrambling~~
* Read-only fix
* ~~Keep file option~~

#### Program Flags

##### -a
Removes the read-only attribute from a file (and wipes it)
##### -p passes
Overwrite the file a custom number of times (the default is 5)
